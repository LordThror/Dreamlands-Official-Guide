               <p class="article-text">Nightmares, spawning from bad memories (Or in some cases from Master Nightmares), are the primary enemy and evil in Dreamlands. There are three types, <a href="#monster">Monster</a>, <a href="#minion">Minion</a>, and <a href="#master">Master</a>. Originally, the Master Nightmare was going to be named the Boss Nightmare, but after several story revisions, including the cutting down of Dreamlands from a planned trilogy to a single entry, the Boss Nightmare was renamed the Master Nightmare. Nightmares have no thought or will of their own, being controlled directly by Master Nightmares, which do have a will, even if it's just to make Dreamlands burn. If they are not controlled by a Master Nightmare (Like the Monster Nightmare that the player first encounters), they tend to stay in one spot and destroy everything near them.</p>

At all times it is undamagable by swords. It also appears once more in a cutscene, staring down at the player in his hospital bed.</p>

He went through several different designs, in which Thror claims to have made the worst pixel art he ever designed.</p>
