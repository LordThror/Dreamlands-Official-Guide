               <p>Nightmares, spawning from bad memories (Or in some cases from Master Nightmares), are the primary enemy and evil in Dreamlands. There are three types, <a href="#monster">Monster</a>, <a href="#minion">Minion</a>, and <a href="#master">Master</a>. Originally, the Master Nightmare was going to be named the Boss Nightmare, but after several story revisions, including the cutting down of Dreamlands from a planned trilogy to a single entry, the Boss Nightmare was renamed the Master Nightmare. Nightmares have no thought or will of their own, being controlled directly by Master Nightmares, which do have a will, even if it's just to make Dreamlands burn. If they are not controlled by a Master Nightmare (Like the Monster Nightmare that the player first encounters), they tend to stay in one spot and destroy everything near them.</p>

               <p>Monster Nightmares are the first enemy that the player encounters. They have the ability to wield basic spells, which can be picked up after they are defeated. They tend to stay in one spot and use spells on enemies at a distance. This is one of the imaginary images that inspired Thror when he began working on Dreamlands.</p>

               <p>The Master Nightmare is the first boss in the game. It does not move, but remains in one spot. It does not become aggressive until it is attacked with a spell or a sword. Once it has been attacked, it fights in three ways. It throws fireballs to the left, right, and down or closes it's eyelid, becoming undamagable, and spawns Minions. It also can chose to do nothing for a few precious seconds. At all times it is undamagable by swords. It also appears once more in a cutscene, staring down at the player in his hospital bed.</p>

               <p>The playerplays as a small boy, who gets knocked out in a car crash (First cutscene). While he is in a coma he dreams about Dreamlands. He is, for now, unnamed. At the end of the game, he awakens, and depending on the final choice the player makes lives haunted for the rest of his life or continues life happier then before. He went through several different designs, in which Thror claims to have made the worst pixel art he ever designed.</p>

They are are sorted into two groups,spells and objects. Spells are split into Basic Spells and Rare Spells. All spells have a cooldown of one second, and some can only be used once. <br> The sword acquired in the first chest and the Health Potion acquired in the second chest are their own category. The sword allows the player to use his melee attack, which gains more power with each new level. The Health Potion restore the Player's Health to 100. It is removed from the inventory when used.</p>

               <p>Basic Spells are the Fire, Ice, and Blast (More commonly known as Bomb) spells. They can be picked up from defeated Monster Nightmares. The Fire spell is fast, and higher damage. The Ice spell does little damage, but reduces the attacker's speed (Defeating the Monster Nightmare will reset the player's speed). Blast spells are slow, but is high damage and is the only spell that has splash damage.</p>
